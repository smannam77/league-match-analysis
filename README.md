# League of Legends Early Game Advantage Analysis

## Introduction

League of Legends is a competitive 5v5 strategy game where early advantages can snowball 
into decisive wins. In professional play, teams closely track performance metrics such as 
gold differential, XP lead, CS advantage, and kill counts to assess their standing at 
various stages of the game.

This project investigates whether **10-minute early-game stats** can predict the *final 
outcome* of a match. Using match data from the 2022 season, we perform exploratory data 
analysis, run hypothesis tests, build predictive models, and evaluate fairness across 
different team conditions.
